# A Common Dad

Welcome to the open source guide to being a decent dad.

Raising humans is far too complex to be left to paid experts. Let's pool our collective experience.

#### How can I get involved?
- Comment on an [existing issue](https://github.com/CommonDad/CommonDad/issues)
- File a [new issue](https://github.com/CommonDad/CommonDad/issues/new). This could be:
   - **An open question.** Include the question mark
   - **A feature request.** expressed as a user story
   - **A bug.** Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual observed behavior
- Contribute original writing to the codebase
   - Open a pull request describing your experience or advice
   - Reference the issue your contribution addresses
   - All contributions will be reviewed, edited, and merged if appropriate

#### Is this a software project?

Of course not.

It is, however, a collaboratively-assembled set of human-readable instructions that when compiled and run may or may not be useful to address common challenges of fatherhood.
